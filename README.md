## About this blog

I made this blog to apply new teches that I'm interested.
now deployed on https://aws.hyjpost.com

front : react, aws-amplify(ci/cd)
back : express, aws-rds, aws beanstalk, aws code-pipeline(ci/cd)

## Current Features

1. Editor
   : Made with Draft.js, tried to mimic the functions on medium. Espectially on sidebar and upperbar.

2. tags
   : any words after '#' become a tag. Can filter posts with tags.
   TODO : make a tree stucture on tag (ex> #javascript/react/draft.js )

3. Save
   : Editor support 'publish' and 'save' if I save and go out editor, I can keep keep writing from last saving when I come back later. Data is saved on localstorage.

4. three.js
   : made simple 'About me' page with three.js. I think three.js is really cool libray. Keep going leaning now.
